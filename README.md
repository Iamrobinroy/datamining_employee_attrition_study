The project enabled to learn that data mining as the core process where a
number of complex and intelligent methods are applied to extract patterns
from data. Data mining process includes a number of tasks such as
association, classification, prediction, clustering, time series analysis and so
on. Here a fictional dataset provided by IBM data scientists is used to study
the process of data mining using CRISP-DM. The attrition in other words is
a natural process of loss of employees from the company. It is studied
understanding how to explore, clean data, create different models,
evaluating them to find the best model and its deployment process using
rapid miner.
